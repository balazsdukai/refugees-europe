A short project looking for answers for the following questions:

1. From which countries did most of the refugees come from and which were their main destination countries?

2. How many of the refugees actually get asylum in the EU?

3. In which of the EU countries would the refugees have the highest chance for integration?

It integrates data from *eurostat* and *UNDP - Human Development Reports*.

*eurostat:* http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database

*UNDP:* http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi
