# Introduction

Due to the crisis in the Middle East and North-Africa people were and are forced to leave their home, heading towards Europe in hope of a better life. Thus in the last couple of years, especially in the second quarter of 2014 and in 2015, the number of people applying for asylum in Europe increased. In the spring and summer of 2015, even increased amount of people started moving to Europe. **Figure 1** shows the increase in the number of first time asylum appications in the EU–28 states between Q2 2014 and Q2 2015.

The EU and its member states were not prepared for such level of immigration, hence these countries faced infrastructural, governmental and societal problems. People living along the main transit routes were directly affected by the flood of refugees. These events gained a huge media coverage, both in social and broadcasted media. Many of us in Europe had an opinion based on the numbers and figures presented in the media. Altough as it is in events too, these numbers and figures can be confusing or misleading. Therefore I wanted to take a look on what data is available and what does it say about this topic. 

In the following lines I am going to focus on answering the questions, such as:

1. From which countries did most of the refugees come from between Q2 2014 and Q2 2015?

2. Which were their main destination countries in this time frame?

3. How is the refugee to citizen ratio in the main destination countires by the end of Q2 2015?



Thus my central research question is:

*What percent of the refugees seeking asylum in the Western Europen countries could have a higher educational level?*

In order to answer such a question, I need to set a few assumptions:

*1. Every class or level of a society is equally affected by either political or economical crisis.*

Unfortunately, this might be a false assumption as we can learn in history classes that mostly the lower educated (thus often also poor) classes of society can feel the impact of a crisis the strongest. But because any society and crisis is a complex system, it is not in the scope of this work to estimate a real impact. Hence, for the sake of simplicity I will assume that every class of a society is equally affected by either political or economical crisis.

*2. There is no distinction between political or economic refugee*

It is still under heavy debate that citizens from which country are considered a political or an economic refugee. I will make no distinction in this work and consider both type of refugees simply as refugees.


### The main destination countries [^bla]
"The highest number of first time asylum applicants in the second quarter of 2015 was registeredin Germany (80 900 applicants, or 38% of total applicants in the EU), Hungary (32 700, or 15%), Austria (17 400, or 8%), Italy, France and Sweden (respectively 14 900, 14 700 and 14 300, or 7% each). These 6 Member States together account for more than 80% of all first applicants in the EU-28 (Table 2)."

### The main departure countries [^1]
"Citizens of 141 countries sought asylum for the first time in the EU in the second quarter of 2015. Syrians, Afghanis and Albanians were the top 3 citizenships of asylum seekers, lodging around 44 000, 27 000 and 17 700 applications respectively (Table 1)."[http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Asylum_quarterly_report#Main_destination_countries]

1. List of the main emmigration and european immigration countries

2. Census data of the relevant countries 

3. educational indexes of the relevant countries 

    + distribution of elementary, high school, university education –> if all levels of the society is equally affected by war / economic crisis, I can just extrapolate this distribution  to the refugees to determine who came
