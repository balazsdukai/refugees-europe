# Introduction

Refugees, asylum seekers and economic migrants ...
This report aims to shed more light on what could we expect in level of education from the asylum seekers who wish to settle in Western-Europen countries. Thus my central research question is:

*What percent of the refugees seeking asylum in the Western Europen countries could have a higher educational level?*

In order to answer such a question, I need to set a few assumptions:

*1. Every class or level of a society is equally affected by either political or economical crisis.*

Unfortunately, this might be a false assumption as we can learn in history classes that mostly the lower educated (thus often also poor) classes of society can feel the impact of a crisis the strongest. But because any society and crisis is a complex system, it is not in the scope of this work to estimate a real impact. Hence, for the sake of simplicity I will assume that every class of a society is equally affected by either political or economical crisis.

*2. There is no distinction between political or economic refugee*

It is still under heavy debate that citizens from which country are considered a political or an economic refugee. I will make no distinction in this work and consider both type of refugees simply as refugees.


### The main destination countries [^bla]
"The highest number of first time asylum applicants in the second quarter of 2015 was registeredin Germany (80 900 applicants, or 38% of total applicants in the EU), Hungary (32 700, or 15%), Austria (17 400, or 8%), Italy, France and Sweden (respectively 14 900, 14 700 and 14 300, or 7% each). These 6 Member States together account for more than 80% of all first applicants in the EU-28 (Table 2)."

### The main departure countries [^1]
"Citizens of 141 countries sought asylum for the first time in the EU in the second quarter of 2015. Syrians, Afghanis and Albanians were the top 3 citizenships of asylum seekers, lodging around 44 000, 27 000 and 17 700 applications respectively (Table 1)."[http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Asylum_quarterly_report#Main_destination_countries]


**Literature research:**

1. Which level of the society is most affected by war?
2. Which level of the society is most affected by economic crisis?

Output: a distribution, or percentage of the total population in a country who is most affected

# The eductaional level of the refugees coming to Europe?

extrapolate the percentage from before to make assumptions on the educational level of the refugees

the difference between the the educational level in the main emmigration countries and the main immigration countries

## But what does this all mean for the welcoming countries?

1. List of the main emmigration and european immigration countries

2. Census data of the relevant countries 

3. educational indexes of the relevant countries 

    + distribution of elementary, high school, university education –> if all levels of the society is equally affected by war / economic crisis, I can just extrapolate this distribution  to the refugees to determine who came
